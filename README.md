# Fast-Food-Management-System-with-an-Intuitive-UI-arduino-and-RFID

This project demonstrates a **simple RFID-based payment system** connected to a **Python interface**.  
The idea is to simulate paying for an order by **tapping an RFID-enabled card** â€” no real bank checks, just instant confirmation for testing and learning purposes.

## How It Works
- The Arduino is connected to an **RFID reader**.
- When a card is tapped, the Arduino reads its UID.
- The UID is sent to a **Python script** via serial communication.
- Python displays a payment confirmation message.

## Features
- ðŸ’³ RFID card detection and reading
- ðŸ”„ Serial communication between Arduino and Python
- âš¡ Instant "Payment Confirmed" feedback
- ðŸ›  Built with **Arduino + Python**

## Components Used
- Arduino board
- RFID Reader Module (MFRC522 or similar)
- RFID/NFC-enabled bank card
- Python for the UI/confirmation message
- USB cable for serial connection

## Disclaimer
> This system is for **educational purposes only**.  
> It does not process real payments or verify cardholder identity.
